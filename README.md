💳 Credit Card Fraud Detection

🔹 Description

The Credit Card Fraud Detection System is a machine learning project that identifies fraudulent transactions by analyzing transaction patterns.
 It applies supervised learning models on real-world datasets to classify transactions as legitimate or fraudulent.

✨ Features

* 📊 Data preprocessing and handling imbalanced datasets
* 🤖 Machine learning models (Logistic Regression, etc.)
* 📈 Model Training, Model Evaluation
* 🔍 Real-time fraud detection simulation
* 📂 Dataset integration (e.g., Kaggle Credit Card Dataset)

 🛠️ Technologies Used

* Language: Python
* Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
* Tools: Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab
* Version Control: Git & GitHub

 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/credit-card-fraud-detection.git
   ```
2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script to train & test the model.



 🎯 Future Enhancements

* Deep Learning (LSTM/Autoencoders) for sequential fraud detection
* API integration for real-time fraud alerting
* Dashboard for transaction monitoring
